# Title
Ted the Octopus - a simulation of octopus growth

# Introduction
There once was an octopus named Ted. Ted wore a brown trilby hat 
and a red bow tie, except for when he is skiing.

Dr Fish first discovered an Octopus in 1903, but we don't think Ted 
is this old.
Mr Aquaman also has studied the history of the Octopus.

# Simulations
John ran his Oct-Mod model to simulate octopus growth
